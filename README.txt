I once again used data from baseball-reference.com. This time, I wanted to explore the conversation of the greatest pitcher of all-time. I chose Pedro Martinez and used consensus lists, the hall of fame list, and compared his peak season to another phenom's season. 

The first chart was the conesnsus bar chart, the second included the two peak pitchers, putting them against every 2019 pitcher who pitched more than 80 innings. The last chart was a Clevend Line Chart comparing Hall of Fame pitcher statistics. I feel the scatter plot is incredibly effective when analyzing pitcher data. In fact, I think it's the best visualization to use, a lot of baseball visualizations use it.

For each of the charts, I wanted to use the color channels in a more meaningful way while still maintaining a lot ink ratio, so I tried color coding the statistics I would be analyzing before the chart would come up. The interactions were tooltips, changing in between charts, and a slide functionality.

The process was getting the data > putting it in openrefine/Excel > Getting the functionality to work on the charts as intended > styling. I did this with each chart individually before going to the next and spent my last day refining any issues I had. 

This project was a bit strange because I couldn't think of anything new I wanted to try that would fit the data I had. Scatter plots are so effective, and I don't think any other data set would've been particularly useful. However, I do think the Clevland Line Chart is fun to look at.
