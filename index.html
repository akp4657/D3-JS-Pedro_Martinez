    <h1>Pedro Martinez -- The G.O.A.T?</h1>

  <div class = "slideshow-container">

    <div class ="mySlides fade">
      <div id ='textDiv'>
        <h3 id='introText'>Pedro Martinez was one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball. His prime was in the late 90s 
          and early 2000s, the height of the steroid era. In that environment, Pedro was simply unhittable, and put offenses 
          to a screeching halt every time he went up to the mound. It’s not outlandish to say this, but I’m going to make a 
          case for Pedro Martinez being the greatest pitcher of all time. The goat (G.O.A.T), if you will.</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class ="mySlides fade">
      <div id ='textDiv'>
        <h3 id='introText'>Now, I took a random list from a Google search “Greatest Pitchers of All Time” and just chose one. 
          All of these pitchers are generally going to be on this list, especially the modern ones such as Pedro, Kershaw, Ryan, 
          and Johnson. They’re undisputed kings of baseball. We’ll look at two stats between these consensus pitchers: 
          <span style='color: #ffffff; -webkit-text-stroke: .35px black;'>ERA</span> and <span style='color: #d0e1f9; -webkit-text-stroke: .35px black;'>ERA+</span>, each being the average of the 
          player’s career. ERA being Earned Run Average, which indicates the average runs scored when a pitcher is on the mound. 
          ERA+ is the same stat, adjusted to the player’s ballpark/run environment, where 100 is average. </h3>

    </div>

    <div class ="mySlides fade">
      <div id ='textDiv'>
        <h3 id='introText'>A huge jump on the chart for Pedro. He had a relatively high ERA on that list comparatively but remember 
          Pedro was pitching at the height of the steroid era. Still, he wasn’t first on that list. It was 
          Clayton Kershaw, an active pitcher for the LA Dodgers. He’s pretty good too. Let’s look 
          a little closer.  </h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class ="mySlides fade">
      <div id ='textDiv'>
        <h3 id='introText'>So, let’s take the 2019 pitchers who had above 80 innings pitched, meaning that they were a significant part of 
          the team either as a reliever or a starter. Then, let’s stick <span style='color: #005A9C'>Clayton Kershaw</span> in there, but at 
          his peak 2013 season. Let’s also put <span style='color: #BD3039'>Pedro Martinez</span> in there at his peak 1999 season. We’ll look 
          at four stats: ERA, ERA+, FIP, and SO/9. You already know about <span style='color: #ffffff; -webkit-text-stroke: .35px black;'>ERA</span> and 
          <span style='color: #d0e1f9; -webkit-text-stroke: .35px black;'>ERA+</span>, so I’ll skip the explanation. Let’s talk about <span style='color: #4d648d'>FIP</span> though. 
          FIP stands for Fielding Independent Pitching, which just looks at the true outcomes between a batter and a pitcher: A walk, strikeout, 
          or hit. It then uses that to calculate the ERA. An ERA that isn’t reliant on your team. Nice. <span style='color: #283655'>SO/9</span>? 
          Well, the average strikeouts a pitcher acquires over 9 innings. So, let’s see what we get.</h3>

    <div class ="mySlides fade">
      <div id='chart1Div'>
        <svg id='chart2'></svg>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class ="mySlides fade">
      <div id ='textDiv'>
        <h3 id='introText'>Clayton had more production as far as inning pitched, and he did have a monstrous ERA of 1.83, but Pedro outperformed 
          him in every other metric, which is unbelievable considering 1999 was, again, <strong>the height of the steroid era</strong>.  
          These aren’t all tell-all stats, but it’s still unbelievably impressive. We’ll take a look at one more chart before you go. </h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class ="mySlides fade">
      <div id ='textDiv'>
        <h3 id='introText'>I forgot to mention, <span style='color: #BD3039'>Pedro Martinez</span> is in the Baseball Hall of Fame, he was inducted in 
          2015. We’ll be looking at a chart that has every Hall of Famer’s <span style='color: #ffffff; -webkit-text-stroke: .35px black;'>ERA</span> and <span style='color: #4d648d'>WAR</span>.
           We already know all about ERA, but let’s go over WAR, or Wins Above Replacement. It essentially calculated the value of a player to their 
           team, using the metric “How many wins could we get if we replaced this guy?” Average WAR in the Hall of Fame for pitchers is 69, the 
           average ERA is 3.00. I’m not making that up.</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class ="mySlides fade">
      <div id ='chart1Div'>
        <svg id='chart3'></svg>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class ="mySlides fade">
      <div id ='textDiv'>
        <h3 id='introText'>What strikes me the most about this chart is just many of the other Hall of Famers have so many more innings pitched that Pedro, 
          yet Pedro was still more productive based on WAR, and we already know his ERA is below the average, his being 2.93. Many of the other pitchers
           on this list could be considered stat accumulators, as nobody in the future will likely ever reach those numbers due to the increasing 
           physicality and limiting pitch counts on pitchers. It’s hard to claim the goat in anything, it takes a lot of cherry-picking and hoping others 
           agree with you. Still, pitching in the steroid era and getting these types of numbers is no easy task. I don’t think any man could do it. Maybe
            a goat could though. I like to think there’s one named Pedro Martinez. </h3>
